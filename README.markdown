Midi input and output addon for openFrameworks

By Chris O'Shea, Arturo Castro, Kyle McDonald & Dan Wilcox

See Documentation on [Github](https://github.com/chrisoshea/ofxMidi) and the [OpenFrameworks Forum post](http://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php/topic,2435.0.html).

OpenFrameworks is a cross platform open source toolkit for creative coding in C++.

[http://www.openframeworks.cc/](http://www.openframeworks.cc/)

Description
-----------

ofxMidi provides [Music Instrument Digial Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface) IO capability to an OpenFrameworks app

* ofxMidiIn: a single midi input port, derive from the ofxMidiListener class to receive messages
* ofxMidiMessage: a received midi message
* ofxMidiOut: a single midi output port, includes a stream << interface

This project utilizes [RtMidi](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/) for Mac, Windows, & Linux and [PGMidi](https://github.com/petegoodliffe/PGMidi) on iOS.

Installation
------------

To use ofxMidi, first you need to download and install OpenFrameworks. ofxMidi is currently developed against the latest version of Open Frameworks on github (007).

To get a copy of the repository you can download the source from [http://github.com/chrisoshea/ofxMidi/zipball/master](http://github.com/chrisoshea/ofxMidi/zipball/master) or, alternatively, you can use git clone:
<pre>
git clone git://github.com/chrisoshea/ofxMidi.git
</pre>

The addon should sit in `openFrameworks/addons/ofxMidi/`.

Midi Routing
------------

### Mac OSX

Checkout a useful app for midi port routing called [MIDI Patchbay](http://notahat.com/midi_patchbay).

### Linux

Check out the Alsa utility apps aconnect & aconnectgui as well as the qjackctl gui for midi port routing control.

### Windows

Windows dosen't come with a virtual MIDI routing system like Linux (ALSA) and OSX (CoreMIDI).

If you want to connect your ofxMidi app to other software (synths, DAWs, etc) check out [loopMIDI](http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/loopMIDI.html). Run the app and create a few virtual ports which you can then connect to within your software. 

Running the Example Project
---------------------------

The example projects are in the ofxMidi/example-input/ or ofxMidi/example-output/ folders.

### OSX

Xcode3: Open the Xcode project and hit "Build and Run". You might want to choose "Release" instead of "Debug" for faster performance.

Xcode4: Open the Xcode project, select the project scheme, and hit "Run".

### Linux

Open the Code::Blocks .workspace and hit F9 to build. Optionally, you can build the example with the Makefile.

To run it, use the terminal:
<pre>
make
cd bin
./example-inputDEBUG
</pre>

### Windows

An example Visual Studio 2010 solution as well as a Codeblocks workspace are included.

Creating a New ofxMidi Project
------------------------------

To develop your own project based on ofxMidi, simply copy the example project and rename it. You probably want to put it in your apps folder, for example, after copying:
<pre>
openFrameworks/addons/ofxPd/example-input/ => openFrameworks/apps/myApps/example-input/
</pre>

It must be 3 levels down in the openframeworks folder structure.

Then rename the folder:
<pre>
openFrameworks/apps/myApps/myPdProject/
</pre>

#### Xcode

Rename the project in Xcode (do not rename the .xcodeproj file in Finder!):
* Xcode Menu->Project->Rename

#### Codeblocks (Win & Linux)

* rename the *.cbp and *.workspace files
* open the workspace and readd the renamed project file by dragging it onto the project tree (it will complain about the missing project you renamed)
* if you renamed the project *folder* make sure to set the project name to this folder name or C::B will not be able to run the binary:
	* right click on project in the tree (not the workspace)
	* Properties...->Title

#### Visual Studio

* rename the *.sln, *.vcxproj, & *.vcxproj.filters files
* open the solution and delete the old project from the projects tree
* go to File->Add->Existing Projects/Solutions and select the *.vcxproj file
* right click on the project in the projects tree and rename it

Adding ofxMidi to an Existing Project
-------------------------------------

### Xcode

* create a new group "ofxMidi"
* drag these directories from ofxMidi into this new group: `ofxMidi/src`
	* if building for OSX, delete the src/ios folder references
	* if building for iOS, delete the src/desktop folder references
* add the CoreMIDI framework to your project
	* Xcode 3
		* right click on your project in the groups & files sidebar
		* Add->Existing frameworks
		* select CoreMIDI.framework from the list
	* Xcode 4
		* click on your project in the sidebar
		* select the Summary tab
		* click the + under Linked Frameworks & Libraries
		* search for and select the CoreMIDI.framework from the list
* add the following directories to your search path in your project's Project.xconfig file (See the Project.xconfig of the example project.):
<pre>
../../../addons/ofxMidi/src
../../../addons/ofxMidi/src/desktop/rtmidi
</pre>

### Linux Makefiles/CodeBlocks

* edit addons.make in your project folder and add the following line to the end of the file: 
	<pre>ofxMidi</pre>

### Win Codeblocks & Visual Studio

* add the ofxMidi sources to the project tree
<pre>
ofxMidi/src
</pre>
	* Codeblocks: right click on the project in the project tree and select Add Files Recursively...
	* Visual Studio: drag the ofxMidi/src folder on the project tree
* add the following search paths:
<pre>
..\\..\\..\addons\ofxMidi\src
..\\..\\..\addons\ofxMidi\src\desktop\rtmidi
</pre>
	* Codeblocks
		* right click on the project in the project tree and select Build Options...
		* select the project name in the tree, not release or debug
		* Search directories tab->Add
	* Visual Studio
		* right click on the project in the project tree and select Properties
		* set the Configuration to All Configurations
		* Configuration Properties->C/C++->General->Additional Directories

DEVELOPING
----------

You can help develop ofxMidi on GitHub: [https://github.com/chrisoshea/ofxMidi](https://github.com/chrisoshea/ofxMidi)

Create an account, clone or fork the repo, then request a push/merge. Please use the *develop* branch of updates and pull requests.

If you find any bugs or suggestions please log them to GitHub as well.

### Adding a Midi Backend

If you want to add a new midi backend (Android, Jack, etc), you'll need two classes derived from ofxBaseMidiIn & ofxBaseMidiOut.

Place your source files in a new folder named after your platform/library and add new include #ifdef flags to ofxMidiIn.h & ofxMidiIn.cpp.

Last, you'll need to add specific #ifdef flags to the static port info ofxMidiIn/Out functions (listPorts, getPortName, etc).

### Updating Midi Libraries

RtMidi & PGMidi can be updated by running the `update_rtmidi.sh` or `update_pgmidi.sh` shell scripts in the scripts folder.

For RtMidi, edit the version setting in the script header and run the script to download and place the RtMidi sources into `src/desktop/rtmidi`.

PGMidi sources are placed in `src/ios/pgmidi`.

#### RtMidi.cpp include

Next, make sure to add the following include to `RtMidi.cpp` at around line 38 or there will be link errors:
<pre>
#include "ofxConstants.h"
</pre>
